# Demyst Assessment Submission

This is the submission repository for the assessment by DemystData. I have implemented a CLI tool that can be used to fetch the even numbered TODO's from the todos API and print their title along with their completion status.

The steps to run this code are below:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm i -g` command to make this tool available system wide
4. From anywhere in your local machine, run the `todos fetch-default` command to fetch the first 20 even numbered todos from the API
5. To fetch custom number of todos, run the `todos fetch <number>` command where `<number>` is the the number of todos to fetch

To execute the **tests**, you can run the `npm run test` command
